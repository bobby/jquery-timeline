# jQuery Timeline

jQuery Timeline is several things:

* A jQuery wrapper around the SIMILE Timeline API
* A collection of enhancements and plugins for SIMILE Timeline
  * A filtering/highlighting widget
  * A Band labeller
  * More to come
* Eventually, jQuery Timeline will re-implement various parts of the Timeline API using jQuery for DOM manipulation, event binding, and animation
